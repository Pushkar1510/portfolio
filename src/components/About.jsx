        Much of my love for programming was ignited by cinema: I still remember the iconic cascading code scene in The Matrix, even if I didnâ€™t understand much on my first watch. Like thousands of other kids all over the world, I was swept away by the superhero craze. At first, all I wanted was a mechatronic suit identical to Tony Stark's, but every rewatch revealed a new layer: soon enough, my attention was grabbed by Jarvis, one of Stark's AI creations.

        I started researching concepts like artificial intelligence and machine learning and was amazed by the sheer potential of computing as a whole. What struck me the most was that developments in computer science help not just fictional superheroes and billionaires but also ordinary people around me. I felt like my calling was to improve the lives of everyone through my work, and this is what drove me to pursue computer science as a career.
